RESEARCH EXPERIENCE



Lumiere Education, Individual Research Scholar	                                                                                                Dec 2022 – May 2023
Received a full scholarship ($2,600) to support this research.
Analyzed the auroral environment to determine the feasible parameters for replicating Auroras (a high altitude phenomenon) in low altitudes. Traversed topics like Magnetic Reconnection, Solar winds, Ionosphere and geomagnetic storms.
Worked under a MIT PhD researcher to further the space weather data analysis. Incorporated python to store & survey space weather repositories and plotted their data points. The result aligned with the 11-year recurring solar cycle.

  NSS Space Settlement Contest, Team Captain	                                                                                        October 2019 - Jan 2020		
Designed a space settlement (Aakash Tarang),  capable of subsisting human life in the Aldrin Cycler orbit. 
Main aspects of this proposal were creation of pseudo gravity, constant oxygen supply and replication of earth like environment in the settlement.
